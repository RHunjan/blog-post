The application is a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well.
The app follows the MVC paradigm and is deployed on Heroku. The app uses Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session
npm package for authentication.
